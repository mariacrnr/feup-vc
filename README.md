## proj1: Homographies for Computer Vision
### Abstract
In this report, we will explore some of the practical applications of
computer vision techniques using the OpenCV library. Among these
techniques we will primarily focus on the use of edge detection,
segmentation, feature point detection and matching techniques,
and geometric transformations to solve real-world problems in
computer vision.
We will then describe our implementation of the techniques including some of the specific algorithms and parameters tested in each
of the techniques. We also present several applications of computer vision that use the
techniques mentioned before, including localizing known objects,
measuring distances on a plane with a single camera, recognizing
objects using template matching, and generating a bird’s eye view
of a lane. Regarding these applications we describe the specific computer vision techniques used and the results achieved, including
any limitations or challenges we encountered.
Overall, this report demonstrates the power and versatility of computer vision techniques and the OpenCV library for solving real-
world problems, as well as the importance of understanding the
underlying theory and parameters involved in these techniques
## proj2: Image Colorization Analysis
### Abstract
Image Colorization is the process of determining color of an initial grayscale image realistically and it has
numerous applications in various fields, such as in medical imaging or entertainment and media. In this report,
we explore, analyze and evaluate models that perform image colorization, as well as study its value as a pretext
task for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL).
